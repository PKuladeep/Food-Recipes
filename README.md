# Food-Recipes
A basic food recipes webpage created using HTML and CSS. It includes well-structured recipe content for popular dishes like Schezwan Noodles, Butter Chicken, and Lasagna. This project is aimed at practicing semantic HTML and organizing content in a clean, readable format. 
This is just a basic code written to practice my HTML and CSS skills as a beginner.
