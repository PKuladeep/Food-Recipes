        Butter Chicken, also known as Murgh Makhani, is a rich and creamy North Indian dish made with tender pieces of chicken simmered in a buttery tomato-based gravy. To make it, boneless chicken pieces are first marinated in a mixture of yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, and garam masala, then grilled or pan-seared until lightly charred. In a separate pan, butter is melted and used to saut√© ginger, garlic, and onions until soft, followed by the addition of pureed tomatoes, which are simmered with spices like cumin, coriander, and more garam masala. Once the sauce thickens and deepens in color, the cooked chicken is added, and the dish is finished with a splash of cream and a bit more butter to give it its signature smooth texture and richness. Garnished with fresh coriander or cream, butter chicken is best served hot with naan, roti, or steamed basmati rice.
