    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian comfort dish made by layering flat pasta sheets with rich meat sauce, creamy cheese, and a savory tomato blend. The heart of the dish is its meat sauce, typically prepared by sautéing onions and garlic in olive oil, then browning ground beef (or a beef and pork mix) before simmering it with tomato puree, tomato paste, herbs like oregano and basil, and a touch of sugar to balance the acidity. This sauce is deeply flavorful and forms the base of the layers. For the creamy component, either a smooth béchamel sauce made from butter, flour, and milk or a ricotta cheese mixture combined with egg and seasoning can be used. The lasagna noodles, whether pre-cooked or oven-ready, are layered alternately with the meat sauce, the white sauce or ricotta, and generous amounts of shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese. Once assembled, the dish is baked in the oven—covered at first to retain moisture, then uncovered to allow the cheese to turn golden and bubbly. After baking, it's important to let the lasagna rest for a few minutes before cutting, so the layers hold together neatly. Garnished with fresh basil or parsley, lasagna is a hearty, satisfying meal perfect for gatherings or a comforting family dinner.
