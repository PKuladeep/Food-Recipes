    <p>
        Schezwan noodles are a spicy Indo-Chinese dish made by stir-frying cooked noodles with vibrant vegetables and a fiery Schezwan sauce. To prepare them, begin by boiling noodles according to package instructions, then drain and toss with a bit of oil to prevent sticking. In a hot wok or pan, heat some oil and saut√© chopped garlic, ginger, and sliced onions until fragrant. Add thinly sliced vegetables like bell peppers, cabbage, and carrots, and stir-fry them on high heat to retain their crunch. Next, add the cooked noodles along with Schezwan sauce (store-bought or homemade from red chilies, garlic, soy sauce, and vinegar), soy sauce, chili sauce (optional for extra heat), and a pinch of black pepper. Toss everything together until the noodles are evenly coated and heated through. Garnish with spring onions and serve hot as a flavorful main dish or a side to complement other Indo-Chinese favorites.
